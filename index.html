	   <p>God, free will, grand design, meaning of life, purpose of humanity — Chloe Zhao explores a lot in the latest film from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Eternals. 
        The Oscar-winning director of Nomadland does so while giving us no less than 10 super superheroes, a Sentient being, a lot of ever-evolving Deviants,
        an end-of-the-world scenario, and the start of a series that is expected to fill the gap the Avengers left.

        It’s a lot to pack into one film, even if it comes in at a long 2 hours and 36 minutes.
        Zhao, though, almost pulls it off, keeping a complex story that spans from outer universe to ancient Mesopotamia, via Bollywood of now, relatively uncomplicated.
        Her characters or Eternals also pack in genuine diversity, good acting and a warmth that is unusual to find in films such as it, which are more intent on impressing than winning over.</p>

            The fourth-most translated book in the world, the Little Prince has been adapted to multiple art forms and has managed to resonate in the hearts of its patrons every single time.<br>
